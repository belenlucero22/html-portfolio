    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio page; My name is Belen Lucero. I am a self taught
      <br />
      front end web developer. I was born and raised in Houston, TX and I am
      <br />
      currently 27 years old. I've made a big decision in wanting to break into
      the
      <br />
      tech industry to bridge the gap of the curent Latinx in tech. There is
      <br />
      currently 2% of Latina women who are apart of this industry. I hope some
      day
      <br />
      be able to contribute to this growing number. I hope you enjoy my page;
      thank
      <br />
      you for being here!
