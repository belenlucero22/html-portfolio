    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time!</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Girl, Interrupted</h3>
    <p>
      A very moody motion picture starring two of my favorite actressess;
      Angelina Jolie & Brittany Murphy. <br />
      It shines a light on women trying to navigate through certain mental
      health issues. <b>8/10</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Rio</h3>
    <p>
      This movie brings me back to fond memories with my younger siblings.
      <br />
      We would rewatch it over and over but would enjoy it as if it was our
      first time experiencing it. <b>9/10</b>
    </p>
    <h3>VHS</h3>
    <p>
      This is my all time favorite suspense film. It's a compilation of a bunch
      of eerie, unexplained VHS <br />
      casettes that someone randomly finds. <b>7/10</b>
